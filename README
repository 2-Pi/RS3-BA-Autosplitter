LiveSplit autosplitter script and splits presets for RuneScape 3 Barbarian Assault speedrunning.

Features:
- Works for Normal Mode and Hard Mode
- Starts timer when entering any wave
- Splits when a wave is completed and, if quickstart splits are on, the next wave is started
- Resets when restarting the first wave of the round or resetting the current wave progress

1. Download and extract files
2. Download and run LiveSplit (http://livesplit.org/downloads/)
